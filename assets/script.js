// Netflix & Grill

// First HTML page: Main landing page
// Will have a nav bar on top with links to about/contact info, socials, etc

// Background images (split?) showing something related to a theater/movie on one side and food on the other

// At least two primary text inputs

// Movie genre
// Recipe ingredient or style

// Try to have a button that then will return a random combo?

// The two primary inputs will need to be saved to local storage, and then those can be accessed by the second html page to display the movie & recipe info

// Footer with necessary info

// Second HTML page: Movie and Recipe cards/info
// Two cards, each will show title, image, maybe try for description/ingredients

// One for the movie result
// Should be to expand/open up a modal to show more details (cast, etc)
// One for the recipe result
// Should be to expand/open up a modal to show more details (list all steps and ingredients)

// Need to access the local storage to grab the search input and make the API requests

// We will need to go through the API requests and determine what info is obtainable/usable

// Then append that usable info to the respective cards on the page

// Ability to re-roll search results
// First try to display the next result from the API object array
// If successful, try to randomize the re-roll result

// Reference the API's as source of data

// Footer with necessary info
